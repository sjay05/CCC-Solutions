# CCC SOLUTIONS

## Info
These are solutions written by me for the Canadian Computing Competition. Python2 is
language being used to write all the solutions. All of the years cover the Junior
division solutions of the CCC contest.

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute, such as submitting a solution to a CCC question
(Junior or Senior), please submit a **pull request**. However for the pull request
to be accepted, I prefer the language to either be **Python (2 or 3) or C++** and it has to pass
on the official CCC grader and/or the DMOJ judge. If you have
found a concern with any file at all, please leave an issue.

## Note:
Some files don't work with the online CCC grader since I did not use the input
`input()` function in some of the files and tested in my IDE itself.
